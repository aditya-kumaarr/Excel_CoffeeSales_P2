- Applied INDEX.MATCH as dynamic arrays to extract product information (Coffee Type, Roast Type, Size, Unit Price, and Sales) from the Products table.
- Calculated sales amount by creating a new column multiplying Quantity and Unit Price.
- Enhanced data readability by adding Coffee Type Name column using IF functions to convert codes to full descriptive names.
- Improved roast type clarity by creating Roast Type Name column using IF functions to convert abbreviations to full names.
- Formatted size column by adding "KG" suffix for better understanding.
- Applied currency formatting to Price and Sales columns for professional presentation.
- Added Loyalty Card column using XLOOKUP to link customer loyalty status.
- Converted data range to Excel table for better data management and automatic range expansion.
- Created pivot tables for dynamic data analysis and chart generation.
